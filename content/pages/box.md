# Trans Boxes

<img src="/extra_static/box-logo.png" class="header-image" alt="Trans box logo by Lily Kelly aka SoLilyKweez" />

We are two elder trans people who want to help our local community prosper.

- The current leads of the project are Uma and Willow; however we are always looking to expand.
- If you are interested in the project, please email us at [northalabamabaskets@gmail.com][baskets-email].

# Intent

Our intention with the boxes is to support newer trans people in the community or those that do not have the funds to access basic gender transition related goods.

It is often daunting, scary, and expensive to shop for the initial supplies. Our hope is that the boxes will make it easier and more comfortable to
start one's gender transition journey.

# Funding

It costs approximately 50$ to create a box. Currently, just Willow and Uma are funding the project to support their community.

We would appreciate your support to help fund the boxes to further support our community. A donation is appreciated if you receive a box, but is absolutely not required.

- If you know of someone that is, or you are interested in supporting us, contact us at [northalabamabaskets@gmail.com][baskets-email].

# Content

We will have 3 types of boxes (but currently only have two):

- Transfem oriented box
- Transmasc oriented box
- Nonbinary oriented box (WIP): a system to select items from any of the boxes you would want or need

# Trans Tape Safety

First and most importantly, trans tape is not required to be used! But if you think it will be helpful for you, please follow all safety procedures.

Here are two great resources on the topic:

- [Trans tape support][trans-tape-help]
- [Winvov chest tape support][wivov-help]
