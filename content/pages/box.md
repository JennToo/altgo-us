# Who are we

As of now we are two elder trans people wanting to help our community. Co-creators of the box are Uma and Willow.

# Purpose of the Boxes

These boxes are made to help those who have just started to figure out who they are. We want to assist those who have a hard time getting supplies for their firsts. Its impossibly hard to go into stores or venues alone to get essentals. With this it allows you to have a starting point. A beginnning to build off of to help you find your true self! 

# Keep us Going

Each box costs us roughly $50. If you are able to donate to us when you recive a box it would be extreamly helpful but NOT required. If you know someone who can give to help us keep these boxes going then please have them reach out to us. We love this community and want to see it grow and florish. Any help you can give to keeping us going is amazing! 

# Box Content

We will have 3 types of boxes but for now we only have two:

 - Transfemme oriented box

 - Transmasc oriented box

 - Enby oriented box (WIP): this will be a system to select items from any of the boxes you would want or need
