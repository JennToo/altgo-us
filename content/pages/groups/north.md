# Trans North Alabama - Adult Support Group (Huntsville)

[<img src="/extra_static/tna-logo.png" class="header-image" alt="TNA logo" />][tna-discord]

This group is hosted in Huntsville and meets several times per month. We
welcome all adult transgender, nonbinary, and individuals otherwise included
in the transgender umbrella regardless of their physical or social state of
transition. You must be 18 or older to attend.

Group meetings are an opportunity for members to discuss whatever is on their
mind as well as providing a safe space to explore gender expression without fear of judgement.

Group membership is kept confidential, and measures are taken to preserve privacy and to avoid outing people.

To help ensure the privacy and safety of the group, exact meeting details are
not publicly available.

- If you would like more information, please [send us an
  email][email-tna] or [join us on Discord][tna-discord].

# Mid-Life Transgender Support Group (Athens)

Our trans-led peer support group is open to people in mid-life or later. Our
support group provides a safe space for people who are transgender, nonbinary,
or otherwise fall under the transgender umbrella,
as well as their significant family members.

We provide a place to come together to support one another as we work though
the challenges of gender dysphoria. Those of us in mid-life may be married,
may be in mid-career, may be a business owner, and may have children
(and grandchildren). Our circumstances and life experiences set us apart from
younger transgender people.

This support group is also a good place to come to get information and
referrals for other services you may need.

- There is no cost to attend our support group.
- For further information, please email us at [NoALaMidLifeGroup@outlook.com][email-midlife],
