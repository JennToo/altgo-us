# Morgan County Name Change Process

**Note**: This process applies to people 19 and up. Those 18 and under have a
completely different set of rules.

This process is expected to take anywhere from 6-10 weeks before you can
obtain the court order, so start accordingly. Add another 4 weeks time
before you can get an updated Alabama ID.

[Here are the official Morgan County guidelines][morgancounty-guidelines].
It is a good reference to have, however it is incorrect and incomplete.

# **Required Documents**

- Social Security card
- Certified copy of your birth certificate
- Unexpired government issued photo ID
- Morgan County lease/deed/rental agreement (if the address on your ID is outdated)
- [ALEA background check][form-alea]
- [FBI background check][form-fbi]
- [Petition to the court, form PS-12][form-ps12]

# Preparation

1. Obtain 2 copies of your fingerprints on FBI Blue Cards at the [Morgan County Sheriff's Office][morgancounty-sheriff].

   - There is a $20.00 fee, **only cash is accepted**.

2. Print and fill the following forms:

   - [ALEA background check][form-alea]
   - [FBI background check][form-fbi]

3. Send the forms out in the mail:

   - The forms must be notarized.
   - Include the necessary fees, paperwork, and fingerprints.
   - ALEA tends to take around 4-6 weeks; the FBI around 6-8.

Once you receive your background checks from ALEA and the FBI, you can
continue with the process.

**Note**: If the address on your ID is outdated, be sure to bring a copy of
your lease, deed, or rental agreement proving residence of Morgan County.

# Filing for the name change

1. [Print and fill court petition PS-12][form-ps12]:

   - Print and hand sign. Be sure to get it notarized.

2. Ensure all paperwork from the preparation list is gathered. It is all required.

3. File everything at the [Morgan County probate office][morgancounty-courthouse].
   - The office is located on the 2nd floor of the [Morgan County Courthouse][morgancounty-courthouse].
   - Pay the filing fee. It is $22, but "subject to change". **Only cash is accepted**.
   - You should get a phone call when it is ready, usually within a few business days.
   - It is advised to get multiple copies of the court order upon pickup. There is usually a fee for this.

**Note**: The probate office does not accept debit or credit cards for paying
filing fees. It is highly advisable to bring cash with you, but if you forget,
they do have an ATM downstairs in the café (with a high fee). The filing fee is $22
but is “subject to change”.

# Notes

This guide is written from the perspective of someone without a criminal
background.

Name changes have been difficult to obtain with a record
from the experience of the local community. It is highly advisable that you
consult with an attorney if you are seeing a legal name change with prior
criminal history.
