A safe space for transgender, nonbinary, and gender questioning adults 18 years and older.

We are mostly comprised of people from Alabama and the surrounding areas, but others are welcome as well!

**For Apple iOS users**

The Trans North Alabama server has been erroneously marked as an age-restricted
server by Discord. This means that for Apple iOS users you may need to login to
Discord on a desktop or laptop and enable this setting:
